# Coffee Machine Readme

This is a simple Python program that simulates a coffee machine. The coffee machine offers three types of beverages: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Users can select their desired beverage, and the program will check if there are enough resources to make it. If the selected beverage is available, the program will prompt the user for payment and provide the beverage along with change (if applicable). The program also keeps track of the available resources and the total profit.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script, and the coffee machine will start.

2. The coffee machine will display a prompt to ask you what type of beverage you want: espresso, latte, or cappuccino. You can also enter "report" to see the current status of the coffee machine (resources and profit) or "off" to shut down the machine.

3. If you choose one of the available beverages (espresso, latte, or cappuccino), the machine will check if there are enough resources to make the selected beverage.

4. If there are enough resources, the machine will prompt you to insert coins to make the payment. You can enter the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

5. After payment, the machine will calculate the change (if applicable) and dispense the selected beverage along with the change.

6. The coffee machine will update its available resources and profit after each transaction.

7. If you choose "report," the machine will display the current amount of water, milk, coffee, and the total profit.

8. You can continue using the coffee machine by selecting another beverage or turning it off by entering "off."

## Note

- Make sure you have Python installed on your computer to run the script.

- The coffee machine has limited resources for water, milk, and coffee. If any of these resources run out, the machine will notify you and stop serving the corresponding beverage.

- Enjoy your virtual coffee experience with the Coffee Machine program!
