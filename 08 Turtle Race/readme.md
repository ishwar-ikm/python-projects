# Turtle Racing Game

This Python program simulates a simple turtle racing game using the Turtle module. Users can place bets on different colors and watch as turtles race to the finish line. Here's how the game works:

1. The program creates a graphical window using the Turtle module, where turtles will race to the finish line.
2. Users are prompted to place a bet on one of the available colors: red, purple, green, blue, yellow, or orange.
3. Six turtles are created, each with a different color, and positioned at the starting line.
4. A random turtle is selected to move forward at each iteration, and its speed is set randomly for some variability.
5. The race continues until one of the turtles crosses the finish line (y-coordinate of 245).
6. The winning turtle's color is determined, and the user's bet is compared to the winner's color.
7. The program displays whether the user's chosen turtle won the race or not.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `turtle_racing_game.py`).
3. Run the Python file using a terminal or an integrated development environment (IDE).

## Dependencies

- Python
- Turtle module (included in Python's standard library)

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to place a bet on one of the colors.
3. Watch the turtle race unfold and see if your chosen turtle wins.
4. The program will display whether you won the bet or not.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how the Turtle module is used to create this simple yet engaging racing game.
