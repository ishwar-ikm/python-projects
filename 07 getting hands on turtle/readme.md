# Turtle Module Programs

This repository contains 6 Python programs that I created while learning the Turtle module. Each program explores different concepts and functionalities of the Turtle graphics library. Below is a brief overview of each program:

## 01_dashed_line
A simple program where the Turtle draws a dashed line by moving forward for 300 units and then skipping some distance before continuing. This demonstrates basic movement and drawing capabilities of the Turtle module.

## 02_shape
The program starts by drawing a triangle and progressively adds more sides to create a decagon, all sharing the same base. Each polygon is drawn with random colors, and their sides are set to 100 units. This program highlights how to use loops and randomization in Turtle graphics.

## 03_random_walk
In this program, the Turtle takes 200 random steps of 30 units each. The direction of each step is chosen randomly, resulting in a visually interesting pattern. This program showcases the ability to incorporate randomness into Turtle graphics.

## 04_spirograph
The spirograph program creates a complex design by drawing 72 circles with varying radii. The interaction of these circles results in intricate patterns. This program demonstrates more advanced usage of Turtle graphics and geometry.

## 05_hirst_painting
Inspired by Damien Hirst's painting (link provided), this program uses the Turtle module to recreate the artwork using randomly placed dots of colors extracted from an image. The colors are first obtained from the `hirst_img.jpg` using the `colorgram` library. This program showcases the combination of image processing and Turtle graphics.

## 06_etch_a_sketch
In this interactive program, a Turtle responds to keyboard inputs to create drawings. The arrow moves based on keyboard input: W to move forward, S to move backward, A to turn left, D to turn right, and Spacebar to reset the Turtle's position. This program demonstrates how to create interactive graphics using the Turtle module.

Feel free to explore each program's source code to learn more about how the Turtle module can be used to create various graphical patterns and designs.
