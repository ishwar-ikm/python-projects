# Blackjack Game

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game allows you to play multiple rounds of Blackjack against the computer.

## How to Play

1. The game will display the logo and prompt you to play a game of Blackjack by typing 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no).
2. If you choose to play ('y'), you and the computer will be dealt two initial cards each.
3. The goal of the game is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it (busting).
4. Numbered cards have their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value gives the best hand.
5. You can choose to hit (get another card) or stand (pass) during your turn. Type 'y' to hit or 'n' to stand.
6. If you or the computer gets a hand value of 21 with the first two cards, it's a Blackjack, and the game ends immediately.
