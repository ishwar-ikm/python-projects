# Hangman Game
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game will choose a random word from a predefined list, and the player needs to guess the letters of the word within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play
The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list.

You will see the length of the word displayed as underscores, representing each letter of the word to be guessed.

You have 6 lives to make incorrect guesses.

Enter a letter as your guess. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s). If it's not in the word, you will lose a life.

The game will show you a drawing of a hanging man representing the remaining lives.

Keep guessing letters until you either reveal the entire word or run out of lives.

If you lose all 6 lives, the game will end, and the correct answer will be displayed.

If you correctly guess all the letters before running out of lives, you win the game!
